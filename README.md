## Ruby Libvips Lambda Layer

Maybe you are using the `ImageProcessing::Vips` interface of the fantastic [image_processing](https://github.com/janko/image_processing) gem which Rails v6 & ActiveStorage will use?

Maybe you are using our [Lamby](https://github.com/customink/lamby) infrastructure to deploy your Rails app to AWS Lambda using simple Rack integration and documentation? If yes to any of the above, this [Lambda Layer](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/working-with-aws-lambda-and-lambda-layers-in-aws-sam/) is just for you.

## Usage

* Clone or fork this repository.
* Make sure you have Docker or AWS CLI installed.
* Run `./bin/deploy`

From there you simply use the arn in your AWS SAM `template.yaml` file.


## Methodology

Simplicity and small file size! We followed the [docs](https://libvips.github.io/libvips/install.html) for `libvips` install. But because AWS Lambda already has ImageMagick and lots of the needed dependencies, the work was very basic.

We used the `lambci/lambda:build-ruby2.5` Docker image from the [docker-lambda](https://github.com/lambci/docker-lambda) project. From there we only had to install a few more dependencies to get libvips installed. The current version is `v8.7.4` and easy to configure if you need something else.

Lastly, we were happy to find that `glib` and `gobject` were already installed and all that was needed were some simple sym links so FFI could load these libraries.


## Contents

Because of the way we build `libvips` by using existing libraries already installed on AWS Lambda, the resulting layer is very small. Only around `9MB` in total un-compressed size.
